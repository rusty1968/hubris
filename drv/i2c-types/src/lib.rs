//! Common types for the I2C server client API
//!
//! This crate works on both the host and embedded system, so it can be used in
//! host-side tests.
//!
//! # Implementation Notes
//!
//! ## Slave Mode Extensions for MCTP Support
//!
//! The I2C server has been extended to support slave mode operations to enable
//! protocols like MCTP (Management Component Transport Protocol) that require
//! peer-to-peer communication. This extension allows the I2C controller to both
//! initiate transactions as a master and respond to incoming transactions as a slave.
//!
//! ### Design Rationale
//!
//! - **Polling-Based Approach**: Slave message retrieval uses polling rather than
//!   notifications to avoid the complexity of asynchronous callbacks and potential
//!   buffer overflow scenarios in a resource-constrained embedded environment.
//!
//! - **Per-Port Configuration**: Slave addresses are configured per controller/port
//!   combination, allowing multiple I2C peripherals to operate independently with
//!   different slave addresses if needed.
//!
//! - **Fixed Buffer Size**: Messages use a fixed 255-byte buffer to match typical
//!   I2C transaction limits and simplify memory management without dynamic allocation.
//!
//! - **Serialization Requirements**: Types used in IPC messages must implement 
//!   `SerializedSize`, `Serialize`, and `Deserialize` for Hubris IPC communication. 
//!   Newtypes like `PortIndex` inherit these requirements when used in serializable 
//!   contexts (e.g., as fields in `SlaveConfig`).
//!
//! - **Large Array Serialization**: Arrays larger than 32 elements require the 
//!   `serde-big-array` crate and `#[serde(with = "BigArray")]` attribute. This 
//!   follows the established Hubris pattern used in `host-sp-messages` and other 
//!   crates for handling buffers that exceed serde's built-in array size limits.
//!
//! ### Usage Pattern
//!
//! 1. Configure slave address: `ConfigureSlaveAddress`
//! 2. Enable slave receive: `EnableSlaveReceive`
//! 3. Poll for messages: `CheckSlaveBuffer`
//! 4. Process received messages
//! 5. Disable when done: `DisableSlaveReceive`
//!
//! This pattern supports protocols like PLDM-over-MCTP-over-I2C where devices
//! need to both send and receive management messages.
